# Final_Project_Yolo_Traffic_Sign_Detection_Aplication
In this study, deep learning-based object detection algorithms were used to enhance the ability of autonomous vehicles to detect objects in their surroundings. Two different approaches were adopted within the scope of the project: YOLO (You Only Look Once) and Detectron2.
